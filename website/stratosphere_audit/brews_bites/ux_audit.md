# UX Audit - Brews with Bites
**URL**: https://www.stratospheresocial.com/eldersburg/brews-with-bites/

## General Observations
A specialty dining event page.

## UX Issues Identified
1.  **Broken Carousel/Gallery**:
    -   The page has a HUGE carousel of images (over 20 slides) at the top. This is overwhelming and pushes the actual event info down the page.
    -   Many of the images look generic or repetitive.
2.  **Content Layout**:
    -   "FEATURING BEST DISHES FROM 2025!" - If the current year is 2025 or prior, this phrasing is odd (implies looking back, or predicting the future?).
    -   "MENU COMING SOON!" - For a food event, the menu is the #1 selling point. Not having it is a drawback.
3.  **Visual Clutter**:
    -   The section "check out our past beer dinners!" lists *many* brewery logos. It's a wall of logos that doesn't add much value to the *current* user looking to book.

## Recommendations
-   **Hero Section**: Replace the massive carousel with one high-quality hero image or video of the dining experience.
-   **Menu Sample**: If the full menu isn't ready, provide a "Sample Menu" or "Past Favorites" to set expectations.
-   **Testimonials**: Add quotes from past attendees instead of just logos.
