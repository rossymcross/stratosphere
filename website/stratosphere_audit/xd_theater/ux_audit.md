# UX Audit - XD Theater
**URL**: https://www.stratospheresocial.com/eldersburg/xd-theater/

## General Observations
A very minimal page describing the XD Theater attraction.

## UX Issues Identified
1.  **Missing Pricing**:
    -   There is NO pricing information on this page. Users don't know if it's per ride, included in a pass, etc.
2.  **Lack of Visuals/Video**:
    -   For a "7D Immersive" experience, a static image of seats (`xd-theater-seats.avif`) does not do it justice. A video trailer or clips of the "12 different movies" would significantly boost conversion.
3.  **No Call to Action**:
    -   There is no button to "Book Now," "See Pricing," or even "Watch Trailer." It's a dead-end page.

## Recommendations
-   **Add Pricing**: Clearly state the cost per ride or pass options.
-   **Video Content**: Embed a video showing people reacting to the ride or snippets of the ride films.
-   **List Movies**: List the 12 movies available (e.g., "Zombies," "Rollercoaster," "Dinosaurs") to appeal to different interests.
