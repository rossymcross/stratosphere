ARCADE
LOAD YOUR PLAYER CARD FOR
ACTION PACKED FUN!
bonus points =
free games!

All of our arcade games are card operated, which means you can load a player card with any balance that you would like and swipe it on any of the games! The more money you add, the more bonus points you get for FREE GAMES! Please refer to the chart for point values.

As you win games, you will earn E-Tickets that will be loaded right to your card. These tickets can be used to redeem prizes from our prize wall! E-Tickets never expire so as long as you keep your card you can continue to build your ticket value to win bigger prizes!
​
Game Cards can be purchased at our front counter or at our Kiosk in the game room.
​
We are not responsible for lost or stolen cards.
