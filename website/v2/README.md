# Stratosphere Social V2 Homepage

This directory contains the proposed V2 homepage for Stratosphere Social Eldersburg.

## Structure

- `index.html`: Main homepage structure.
- `css/styles.css`: Styling using modern CSS variables and flexbox/grid.
- `js/main.js`: Basic interactivity (mobile menu).
- `assets/`: Contains the hero video (`hero.mp4`), logo, and feature images.

## Features

- **Hero Video**: Uses `file.mp4` as a full-screen background.
- **Navigation**: Clean, responsive navigation bar with "Book Now" CTA.
- **Feature Cards**: Highlights Eat, Play, and Events sections.
- **Modern Design**: Dark mode aesthetic for the hero, clean cards for content.

## Usage

To view the site, open `index.html` in a web browser. For best results (especially for video autoplay policies), serve it using a local development server:

```bash
# Example using python
python3 -m http.server
# Then visit http://localhost:8000/v2/
```
