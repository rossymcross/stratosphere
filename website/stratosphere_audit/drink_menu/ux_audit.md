# UX Audit - Drink Menu
**URL**: https://www.stratospheresocial.com/eldersburg/drink-menu/

## General Observations
Similar to the food menu, this page relies heavily on images for content.

## UX Issues Identified
1.  **Accessibility**:
    -   The main drink menus are images (`2025-Fall-Drink-Menu.jpg`, etc.). Screen readers cannot parse this.
    -   Mobile users must zoom in to read ingredients and prices.
2.  **Incomplete Information**:
    -   There is a text list of "seasonal craft beers," which is good for accessibility/SEO, but it lacks prices, ABVs, or descriptions. It's just a list of names.
3.  **Searchability**:
    -   Users cannot search for "vodka" or "IPA" effectively within the image-based menus.

## Recommendations
-   **HTML Menu**: Convert the cocktail and wine lists to HTML text.
-   **Beer Details**: Add ABV, brewery location, and price to the beer list.
-   **Filters**: Allow filtering by spirit (Vodka, Gin, Whiskey) or beer style (IPA, Lager, Stout).
