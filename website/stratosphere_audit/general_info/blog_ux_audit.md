# UX Audit - Blog
**URL**: https://www.stratospheresocial.com/eldersburg/blog/

## General Observations
A standard blog listing page.

## UX Issues Identified
1.  **Content Relevance**:
    -   Posts like "Ring in 2026 Right..." might be outdated if viewed later in the year.
2.  **Formatting**:
    -   Typical WordPress blog layout. The "Read More »" links are standard but not very engaging.
3.  **Visuals**:
    -   Thumbnail images are small and sometimes cropped awkwardly.

## Recommendations
-   **Featured Post**: Highlight the most recent or most popular post with a larger image/card.
-   **Categories**: Allow filtering by topic (Events, Community, News) if the content volume justifies it.
