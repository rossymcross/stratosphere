# UX Audit - Join Our Team
**URL**: https://www.stratospheresocial.com/eldersburg/join-our-team/

## General Observations
A recruitment page outlining benefits and values.

## UX Issues Identified
1.  **External Link Clarity**:
    -   The "Apply Today!" and "Click here to apply" buttons link to Indeed.com. While functional, it's better to open these in a new tab (which it might, but should be explicit) or embed the jobs if possible. The text "Click here to apply" is poor accessibility practice; "View Open Positions on Indeed" is better.
2.  **Layout**:
    -   The list of perks is a bit text-heavy and could use icons or a better grid layout to be more scannable.
3.  **Company Culture**:
    -   The "Service, Ownership, Commitment..." list is just a list of words in caps. Adding a brief sentence about what each means to the company would add depth.

## Recommendations
-   **Job Board Integration**: If possible, embed the Indeed job feed so users can see openings without leaving the site immediately.
-   **Employee Testimonials**: Add quotes or videos from current staff to show *why* it's a fun place to work.
-   **Better Button Text**: Rename "Click here to apply" to "View Current Openings".
