WE'RE TAKING AXE THROWING TO A NEW LEVEL

Our targets are projected onto the wood which means you are not throwing at the same boring painted circle over and over again. Our interactive axe throwing targets allow you to mix it up by moving the bullseye or play different games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect 4 or choose to throw your axes at zombie faces!
