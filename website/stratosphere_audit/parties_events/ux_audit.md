# UX Audit - Parties & Events
**URL**: https://www.stratospheresocial.com/eldersburg/parties-events/

## General Observations
This is a critical revenue-driving page with a lot of complex information (packages, prices, FAQs).

## UX Issues Identified
1.  **Information Overload**:
    -   The page lists many packages (Karaoke, Themed Karaoke, Bowling Packages x3, Nerf War, Axe & Bowl) with varying details.
    -   The layout is very long and requires significant scrolling.
2.  **Lack of Comparison**:
    -   Users have to scroll back and forth to compare the "Level Up" vs "Supercharged" packages. A comparison table would be much better.
3.  **Typography & Consistency**:
    -   Headings are inconsistent (some all caps, some not).
    -   Pricing caveats (taxes, service charge) are repeated constantly, adding visual clutter.
4.  **FAQ Section**:
    -   The FAQ is a long list of text. An accordion style (expand/collapse) would clean up the page significantly.
5.  **Navigation**:
    -   The "Contact Us" and "Birthday Party FAQ" links at the top are good, but anchor links to specific package types (e.g., "Jump to Nerf War") would help.

## Recommendations
-   **Comparison Table**: Create a "Compare Packages" table for the Game Zones.
-   **Accordion FAQs**: Collapse the FAQ section to save space.
-   **Package Cards**: Design distinct cards for each package with clear hierarchy (Price, Includes, Book Button).
-   **Sticky CTA**: A "Book Your Party" button that stays visible or appears at the bottom of the screen on mobile.
