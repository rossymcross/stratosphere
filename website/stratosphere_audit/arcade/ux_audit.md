# UX Audit - Arcade
**URL**: https://www.stratospheresocial.com/eldersburg/arcade/

## General Observations
A simple page that explains the card system.

## UX Issues Identified
1.  **Missing Pricing**:
    -   The text mentions "Please refer to the chart for point values" and "The more money you add, the more bonus points you get," but the chart is likely the image `bonus-points_PNG.avif`.
    -   **Accessibility**: This is another instance of text-as-image. A user with a screen reader won't know the bonus tiers.
2.  **Lack of Engagement**:
    -   There are no photos of the *actual* arcade games or the "prize wall" mentioned. Showing the experience is key for an arcade.
3.  **Content**:
    -   The text is functional but a bit dry. It explains the *mechanics* of the card but not the *fun* of the games.

## Recommendations
-   **HTML Pricing Table**: Recreate the "Bonus Points" chart in HTML.
-   **Visuals**: Add a gallery or carousel of popular games and the prize counter to build excitement.
-   **Game List**: Consider listing some top games (e.g., "Mario Kart", "Halo", "Skee-Ball") to help SEO and user interest.
