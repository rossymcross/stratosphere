Bring Your Appetite

Taste your way through our restaurant’s delicious handcrafted menu that has something for everyone to enjoy! 

Open Monday–Sunday for lunch, dinner & carry-out. 

Bring the crew and settle in—our bar is shaking cocktails and pouring cold drafts while the kitchen keeps the flavor coming. Game on? Sports bar vibes are always lit with cheers, high-fives, and can’t-miss moments on the big screens. Whether you’re here for a family feast or a late-night hang, our full-service restaurant serves up crave-worthy shareables, stacked burgers, flatbreads, and more. 

Make it a party: start with wings and apps, refuel with bowls and wraps, then toast another round at the bar. Dine in, cheer on your team, or snag carry-out and keep the fun rolling at home. Stratosphere Social is your neighborhood bar, sports bar, and restaurant all in one.
