# UX Audit - Hours
**URL**: https://www.stratospheresocial.com/eldersburg/hours/

## General Observations
A simple, informational page.

## UX Issues Identified
1.  **Information Duplication**:
    -   The hours are listed in the main content area *and* in the footer immediately below it. This is redundant.
2.  **Holiday Hours List**:
    -   The list includes holidays that have passed (e.g., 4th of July, Memorial Day). This creates visual clutter. It should only show *upcoming* holiday exceptions.
3.  **Lack of "Open Now" Indicator**:
    -   Users have to do the mental math ("Is it Tuesday? Is it 11pm?"). A dynamic "Open Now / Closed" indicator is a standard UX expectation for venue sites.

## Recommendations
-   **Dynamic Status**: Add a "We are currently OPEN until 10pm" widget.
-   **Clean Up Holidays**: Only display upcoming holidays to reduce cognitive load.
-   **Google Maps Integration**: Embed a map here or a "Get Directions" button since hours and location go hand-in-hand.
