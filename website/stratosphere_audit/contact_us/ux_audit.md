# UX Audit - Contact Us
**URL**: https://www.stratospheresocial.com/eldersburg/contact-us/

## General Observations
A functional contact page.

## UX Issues Identified
1.  **Map Integration**:
    -   There is an address but no embedded Google Map. Users have to copy/paste or click the footer link to see where it is.
2.  **Form Feedback**:
    -   It's unclear what happens after submission (no "Success" message visible in the static audit, but worth noting to test).
3.  **Redundancy**:
    -   Contact info is listed at the top *and* in the footer directly below.

## Recommendations
-   **Embed Map**: Add an interactive Google Map.
-   **FAQ Link**: Add a "Before you ask..." section linking to FAQs (Parties, Hours) to reduce unnecessary form submissions.
