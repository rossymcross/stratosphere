# UX Audit - Trivia Night
**URL**: https://www.stratospheresocial.com/eldersburg/trivia-night/

## General Observations
A weekly event page.

## UX Issues Identified
1.  **Content Clarity**:
    -   The "Final Countdown Trivia Tournament" dates (Nov 26 - Jan 1) might be outdated depending on when this page is viewed. If today is past Jan 1st, this content is stale.
2.  **Lack of Visuals**:
    -   No photos of people playing trivia, winning prizes, or having fun. It's just text on a background.
3.  **Call to Action**:
    -   "Happy Hour Specials" is a link, but maybe a "View Menu" or "Get Directions" would be more relevant since it's first-come, first-served.

## Recommendations
-   **Event Calendar**: Integrate with a calendar system so past tournaments don't show up.
-   **Social Proof**: Add photos of past winners or the "Trivia Trophy."
-   **FAQ**: Simple questions like "Do I need to register?" (Answer: No, it's first come first served) should be explicit.
