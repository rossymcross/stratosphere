# UX Audit - Dueling Pianos
**URL**: https://www.stratospheresocial.com/eldersburg/duelingpianos/

## General Observations
A dedicated event page with ticket options.

## UX Issues Identified
1.  **Broken CTA Buttons**:
    -   All booking buttons say "coming soon" (lowercase). This might be accurate if tickets aren't on sale, but if they *are*, this is a conversion killer.
    -   If tickets *are* coming soon, there should be a "Notify Me" option or a specific date when they go on sale.
2.  **Typo**:
    -   "Whether your looking..." (should be "you're").
3.  **Layout**:
    -   The pricing tiers (8-Top, 4-Top, General Admission) are stacked vertically. A side-by-side comparison would be cleaner on desktop.
4.  **Date Specificity**:
    -   "Next show Friday, February 13th." This content needs manual updating. If forgotten, the site looks abandoned. A dynamic calendar feed is better.

## Recommendations
-   **Fix "Coming Soon"**: If tickets are available, fix the button text. If not, add a "Join Waitlist" feature.
-   **Proofreading**: Fix grammar errors ("your" -> "you're").
-   **Dynamic Dates**: Use an event management system to display upcoming dates automatically.
