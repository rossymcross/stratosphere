# UX Audit - Bowling
**URL**: https://www.stratospheresocial.com/eldersburg/bowling/

## General Observations
The page provides pricing and general information but suffers from layout and content clarity issues.

## UX Issues Identified
1.  **Pricing Layout**:
    -   The pricing per day is listed in a vertical stack that takes up a lot of vertical space on mobile. A table or grid would be much cleaner.
    -   Repetitive text ("$40 per lane, per hour + tax") creates visual noise.
2.  **Booking Information**:
    -   The "First come, first served" policy is crucial but buried in text blocks.
    -   The CTA "Click here to check out our party packages" uses generic link text ("Click here") which is poor for accessibility.
3.  **Visual Design**:
    -   Headings like "Let the Good Times ROLL!" are split awkwardly across lines.
    -   Large blocks of text at the bottom ("Stratosphere is more than a bowling alley...") feel like SEO filler and are unlikely to be read.
4.  **Missing Functionality**:
    -   No way to see lane availability (due to first-come policy), but perhaps a "Current Wait Time" indicator (if technically feasible) would be a huge value add.

## Recommendations
-   **Pricing Table**: Consolidate the daily pricing into a clean, easy-to-read table.
-   **Clearer Policy**: Highlight the "First Come, First Served" policy in a callout box so users don't miss it and get frustrated.
-   **Better Link Text**: Change "Click here" to "View Party Packages".
-   **Reduce SEO Text**: Trim the bottom text to focus on user value (e.g., "Other Attractions").
