# UX Audit - Attractions & Specials
**URL**: https://www.stratospheresocial.com/eldersburg/attractions-specials/

## General Observations
This page serves as a hub for the various entertainment options. It uses an alternating list layout (Zig-Zag) which is effective for scanning.

## UX Issues Identified
1.  **Inconsistent CTAs**:
    -   Buttons have varying text: "PRICING", "More Info", "Event inquiry", "Learn More". While some variation is context-dependent, it can be confusing. For example, "Event inquiry" for "Indoor Backyard" vs "More Info" for "Arcade". Does the Backyard not have a general info page?
2.  **Visual Hierarchy**:
    -   Headings like "7d xd theater" appear to have line breaks that might look odd depending on screen size or implementation (`7d xd` then `theater`).
3.  **SEO vs UX**:
    -   The main heading "FUN THINGS TO DO NEAR ME" is clearly an SEO play. It looks unnatural to a human user. A better heading would be "Our Attractions" or "Entertainment Options".
4.  **Content Density**:
    -   Text blocks are quite dense. Bullet points or shorter paragraphs would make it more skimmable.
5.  **Images**:
    -   Good quality images that show people having fun (social proof).
    -   Some images are `webp` (good).

## Recommendations
-   **Standardize CTAs**: Use consistent language (e.g., "View Details", "Book Now").
-   **Refine Headings**: Change "FUN THINGS TO DO NEAR ME" to something more brand-appropriate.
-   **Layout**: Consider a grid layout for attractions on mobile to reduce scroll length.
