# UX Audit - Axe Throwing
**URL**: https://www.stratospheresocial.com/eldersburg/axe-throwing/

## General Observations
A content-rich page that suffers from layout issues and information overload.

## UX Issues Identified
1.  **Layout & Typography**:
    -   Pricing is extremely difficult to read. It uses a mix of all-caps, different colors, and non-tabular data ("TUES & WED: $15... THURS (50% off): $7.50"). This should be a clean table.
    -   Line height in the "AXE THROWING HOURS" section is inconsistent.
2.  **Hierarchy**:
    -   Important safety rules are buried in a "THINGS TO KNOW" list at the bottom. The alcohol limit (2 drinks) is critical and should be prominent near the booking button.
3.  **Call to Action**:
    -   There are multiple "book now" and "Sign waiver" buttons. The "Sign waiver" button is good to have, but "Book Now" takes you to a third-party site (`events.stratospheresocial.com`). The transition could be smoother.
4.  **Images**:
    -   The image of the "Axes & Ales" poster is used as content. This is not accessible and likely scales poorly on mobile.

## Recommendations
-   **Pricing Table**: Convert the pricing text block into a responsive table.
-   **Highlight Rules**: Use icons for key rules (15+ age, closed-toe shoes, 2-drink limit).
-   **Simplify Hours**: Use a standard hours block instead of a text list.
-   **Waiver Integration**: Make the waiver signing part of the booking flow if possible, or clarify *when* it needs to be signed (e.g., "Sign online to save time at check-in").
