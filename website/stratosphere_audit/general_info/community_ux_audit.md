# UX Audit - Community
**URL**: https://www.stratospheresocial.com/eldersburg/community/

## General Observations
A page highlighting charitable partnerships.

## UX Issues Identified
1.  **Gallery Overload**:
    -   Like the "Look Inside" page, there is a massive block of uncaptioned images at the bottom. It's unclear if these are from past events or just general photos.
2.  **Date Specificity**:
    -   "April 1st – April 30th" is listed for Sundi's Gift. Is this for the current year? Past year? It needs a year to avoid confusion.
3.  **Formatting**:
    -   The text blocks are centered and can be hard to read on wider screens.

## Recommendations
-   **Curated Gallery**: Reduce the number of images and add captions explaining the events (e.g., "2024 School Supply Drive").
-   **Dynamic Dates**: Ensure dates include the year or use relative terms ("Every Spring").
